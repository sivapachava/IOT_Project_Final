== Introduction to the Adafruit HUZZAH32 - ESP32 Feather

ESP32 is a series of low-cost, low-power system on a chip microcontrollers with integrated Wi-Fi and dual-mode Bluetooth link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP32[(Wiki)].

The main microcontroller we use is a link:docs/adafruit-huzzah32-esp32-feather.pdf[FeatherBoard Adafruit HUZZAH32], that contains the link:docs/espressif-esp-wroom-32.pdf[Espressif ESP32-WROOM-32 module], a generic Wi-Fi + Bluetooth + Bluetooth Low Energy microcontroller unit. At its core, the ESP32-WROOM-32 module uses the link:docs/espressif-esp32.pdf[ESP32-D0WDQ6 chip].

Browse the specifications about the ESP32-D0WDQ6, the ESP32-WROOM-32, and the FeatherBoard Adafruit HUZZAH32, and **answer the following questions:**

1. **What kind and how much of flash memory do each SoC provide?**

  ESP32-D0WDQ6 -- No embedded flash, ESP32-WROOM-32 -- 4 MB of external SPI flash, Adafruit HUZZAH32 -- 4 MByte flash

2. **What is the difference between pin A0 and pin A2?**

  A0 -- Used for both Analog output and analog input (it has ADC and DAC)
  A2 -- Used for only Analog input and not as a analog output (It has only ADC)

3. **Which ADC pins can't be used once the WiFi is initialized? Why? (WARNING: there are contradictory statements in the FeatherBoard Adafruit HUZZAH32 document, so double check online)**
  
  Once wifi has started, we can only read analog inputs on ADC #1 and we can't use ADC #2 because it is used as a wifi driver.

4. **Which GPIO pins are input only?**

  From GPI #34, GPI #36 and  GPI #39.

5. **On which SoC is the WiFi antenna? the Bluetooth antenna?**

 The ESP32 from Espressif Systems is a 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi and Bluetooth SoC with integrated antenna switches. 
 ESP32 can interface with other systems to provide Wi-Fi and Bluetooth functionality through the SPI / SDIO or I2C / UART interfaces.

6. **What are GPIO6 to GPIO11 used for?**

  GPIO6 to GPIO11 are connected to the integrated SPI flash integrated on ESP32-WROOM-32 (ESP-WROOM-32) and are not recommended for other uses.

7. **On the FeatherBoard Adafruit HUZZAH32, there is a small chip with the inscription `SIL 2104 F0199 1705+`. What is that for?**
  
  It is a highly-integrated USB-to-UART Bridge Controller provides a complete plug and play interface solution.

8. **Which GPIO pins are recommended for digital output? Digital input?**

  IO12 to IO16, IO21, IO27,IO33, and IO32.

9. **Why is GPIO#13 special?**

  an analog input A12 on ADC #2. It's also connected to the red LED next to the USB port

10. **How can the ESP32 hall sensor be used? (to do what, with reading what on what pin)**

  ESP32 integrates a Hall sensor based on an N-carrier resistor. When the chip is in the magnetic field, 
  the Hall sensor develops a small voltage laterally on the resistor, which can be directly measured by the ADC.

11. **What UART is used for bootloading/debug?**

  The Protocol Used in UART Bootloader is based on Ymodem protocol. The Ymodem protocol sends data in 1024-byte blocks.

12. **What is a JST jack? What is it used for on the FeatherBoard Adafruit HUZZAH32?**

  JST connectors are the electrical connectors manufactured to the design standards. 
  BAT is the positive voltage to/from the JST jack for the optional Lipoly battery on the FeatherBoard Adafruit HUZZAH32. The JST connector polarity is matched to Adafruit LiPoly batteries.

13. **What is the USB voltage?**

    Most computer USB ports supply 5V

14. **What happens if we connect `GND` and `USB`? (DO NOT TRY)**

    The connections will destory and the smoke out.

15. **What is the Serial0 interface used for?**

    Serial 0/0 means that this is the first interface from a module, attached in slot 0 into the cassis of the router.

16. **What are 32 KHz crystals used for?**

    It is 'cheap as chips' and it is one kind of the clock crystal frequency for timing device, mainly used on the small communication devices.

17. **When the ADC is configured with `atten=3`, what integer would we read when measuring 1V?**

 atten = 3 then min voltage = 100 mv and max volt = 1300 mv 

 then integer value when measuring 1 v is 1000

== Flash MicroPython on the ESP32

link:https://micropython.org/[MicroPython] is a full Python compiler and runtime that is optimized to run on microcontrollers. One can use an interactive prompt (the REPL) to execute commands immediately, or upload a set of python files to the microcontroller.

In this lab we will flash the micropython firmware on the ESP32, then use the Pymakr extension for link:https://code.visualstudio.com/Download[Visual Studio Code].

Follow the MicroPython tutorial link:https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp32/tutorial/intro.html#esp32-intro[Getting started with MicroPython on the ESP32], and keep in mind the notes below.

NOTE: the "port" setting is `COM*` on Windows, `/dev/ttyS*` on Linux, `/dev/cu.*` on macOS (where * means "something"). Follow link:https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/establish-serial-connection.html#check-port-on-windows[this guide for Windows] or link:https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/establish-serial-connection.html#check-port-on-linux-and-macos[this guide for Linux and macOS] to find what port the FeatherBoard Adafruit HUZZAH32 is using.

NOTE: Windows users. If you don't see the COM port for your device, it may mean that the CP2104 USB to UART Bridge controller pilots are not installed. You can install link:https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers[download them] and install them manually from the Device Manager.

NOTE: Windows users, you may use the Windows Subsystem for Linux version 1 (WSL1) to run commands. If your "port" setting is `COM5` on windows, then it becomes `/dev/ttyS5` on WSL1. Make sure your distribution uses WSL1 (not WSL2). If not, you can either convert an existing WSL2 distribution to WSL1, or install a fresh WSL1 distribution. Find tutorials online. 

== Open the interactive prompt (the REPL)

Once the MicroPython firmware is flashed on the device, you can install the Pymakr extension for link:https://code.visualstudio.com/Download[Visual Studio Code].


1. Make sure you have link:https://code.visualstudio.com/Download[Visual Studio Code] installed 
2. Make sure you have the following extensions installed: link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.python-extension-pack[Python Extension Pack], link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance[Pylance], link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pycom.Pymakr[Pymakr].

In the Pymakr extension tab, you should find your device under `DEVICES`. Click on "Connect Device" (🗲 button), then on "Create a Terminal". 

That's it, you opened a REPL on the ESP32! Let's play a bit with it.

.Answer these questions and copy your code snippets below 
. What is such a capacitor used for?

 The 0.1uF capacitor is Used on all sorts of applications to decouple ICs from power supplies.
  Normally 0.1uF is the traditionally used value. We connected in parallel to a larger capacitor.

. Light up the LED, test different colors and intensities
. Compare the datasheet and the the neopixel MicroPython driver sourcecode: 
.. Do we need to send data at 800Kbps or 400Kbps?

  400Kbps

.. How long would it take to change the color of a strip of 100 WS2812B?

less than one second

.. Where is it justified in the datasheet that the input voltage can be 3.3V (3.5V actually) even though the WS2812B is powered at 5V?
In the second page of the datasheet, table name - Absolute maximum rating,  
Power supply voltage can be +3.5 to +5.3 v
.. What are T0H, T1H, T0L, T1L, used for? 

  T0H is used for 0 code, high voltage time, T1H is for 1 code, high voltage time, T0L is for 0 code, 
  low voltage time and T1L is for 1 code ,low voltage time. Here “1” and “0” bits are indicated by varying 
  the duty cycle of a fixed-frequency square wave.

Every briefcase should contain a link:https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-oled-featherwing/[Adafruit FeatherWing 128x32 OLED display], which contains a link:docs/UG-2832HSWEG02.pdf[128x32 SSD1306 OLED] controllable using the common link:SSD1306.pdf[SSD1306 I2C Driver], and three buttons A, B, C. You need to check out the following guides for this exercise:

* link:https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp8266/tutorial/ssd1306.html?highlight=ssd1306[Using a SSD1306 OLED display]
* link:https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/library/framebuf.html?highlight=framebuf#module-framebuf[`framebuf` — frame buffer manipulation]
* link:https://github.com/micropython/micropython-lib/blob/master/micropython/drivers/display/ssd1306/ssd1306.py[sources of the `ssd1306.py` MicroPython module]

.Answer these questions and copy your code snippets below 
. What does I2C stands for?

 Inter-Integrated Circuit - The I2C protocol is used to establish communication between two or more ICs (Integrated Circuits), hence why it's known as Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) communication.

. To what pins are buttons A, B, C, connected?

1. Button A is #15 of ESP32
2. Button B is #32 of ESP32
3. Button C is #14  of ESP32 

. What is the default I2C address for the I2C peripheral? 

Check from the link:SSD1306.pdf[official documentation] section 8.1.5 a), with "SA0"=0. and "R/W#"=0. In most cases the default I2Cadress is 0x27. 

. Print the current date and time on the screen, update every second.

while True:
    if input.value() == 0:
        display.invert(1) 
    else:
        display.invert(0)

value = 0

display.text("Counter", 0, 0, 1)
display.show()
def incrementValue(change):
     global value
     value += 1
         
input.irq(handler=incrementValue, trigger=Pin.IRQ_FALLING)

valueOld = 0
while True:
    if valueOld != value:
        display.fill(0)
        display.text("Counter", 0, 0, 1)

. The source of the `framebuf.FrameBuffer` class that `SSD1306` inherits from, and its methods, is actually defined in a C file in the link:https://github.com/micropython/micropython/tree/master/extmod[`extmod` folder] of the MicroPython repository (see link:https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/develop/gettingstarted.html?highlight=extmod#folder-structure[description here]). 
.. Find the file + line where the constructor is defined
modframebuf.c
.. Find the file + line where the `text` method is defined
modframebuf.c 

line No - 787
function name  -  framebuf_text()
. In this file, we see that the `framebuf.FrameBuffer.text()` method uses the `font_petme128_8x8` object at line 794, which stores the pixel array for each ascii character and is defined in a library that is included at line 35.
.. Describe how each character is defined as bits and bytes.

each byte is a column of 8 pixels, LSB at top
.. Choose a little monster in the image below, and write what would be the 8 bytes to display this monster.
. Using your answer to question 8b, print one of the monsters below on the screen.
